# The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go

Crowdliness is about living in an embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing marketplace of marketplaces.

Whether you like or not, [if you are reading this] you have become part of the BigMachine ... we define the BigMachine as the vast internetwork of one million key developers and project leaders, one billion actively-engaged power users and at least ten billion [and increasing rapidly] networked, often passive, not-always-human user nodess.

The Crowd has become inescapable in all realms of business, education, science and government. 

Crowdliness is about enjoying Life within the Crowd ... and it's also about unplugging from the Crowd and having some semblance of a healthy life in spite of the Crowd, in the shadow of the Crowd.

Crowdliness is about an inherently social approach to living well within the Crowd. The Crowd has absolutely no need of any additional work evangelically extolling the virtues of things like artificial intelligence, the internet, microprocessors or the transistor. There's also no particular reason to advocate a more outgoing or gregaraious personality. Crowdliness assumes that your personality is not going to change AND it assumes that *progress* in technology will continue, even though many people will not see everything about technology as real progress.

Crowdliness simply assumes that the trend toward embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing big marketplace of interconnected marketplaces will continue unabated ... quite simply, it is hideously STUPID to live life looking in the rear view mirror hoping to go back ... ***we are not going that way*** and no amount of whining will bring about a change in direction, because ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.  

It is antithetical to any form of technophobia or [Ludditism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) or especially any of the radically anti-technology [points of view heavily influencing the Unabomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unabomber_Manifesto#Influences) ... in spite of OR maybe even BECAUSE of the whining ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.
