# Crowdliness ... Read The Crowd To Make Yourself Useful

Almost any halfway decent AI contentbot can generate better content [by using what has been written in the last 2500 years or so] than what you will read in the news media ... you are better off looking at sufficiently old *bestsellers* that were exhaustively studied in their day, especially valuable might be the Classics or the timeless ancient wisdom from sacred texts ... ANY time spent worrying about what might be trending in the news is worse than merely useless -- content now is engineered and studied to draw lowest-common-denominator consumers with clickbait that makes people feel needy or anxious about culture, politics, their fellow humans ... stop being a sucker ... read the Classics, go at least a couple decades back to see how predictions and prognostications play out. 

## If you want to LEARN to read the crowd, then you can't be misled by current content and mind manipulators

We curate lists of old content and see how successful our forebearers were at reading the crowds of their day. Not that much has changed. The most recent stuff that we look at is at least a decade old ... but that's enough time that we can ask #IsItTrue?
