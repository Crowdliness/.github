# Crowdliness Is A Matter Of Emergent Alchemy

It's not exactly magic ... but crowdliness can *feel* like magic ... it's impossible to say who or what exactly is going to satisfy the crowd's urgent need, but the crowd is going to go toward where the crowd is going to go.

People who are crowdly in the same sense that others are worldly, can sniff out when something is about to attract a crowd because the seemingly random, magic emergence of something with attributes of *crowdliness* is actually a matter of ditching the celebrites, but actually paying closer attention to the kinds of creative intelligence that's working like a fiend but is still out of favor ... those most intelligent, most creative types may eventually be made into *instant* celebrities, but the fact of the matter is that most *overnight successes* were doing two things, once: 1) First of all, they were working like manaical obscessed fiends in complete love with their art, their idea, but they felt like they were all alone AND 2) Secondly, and more importantly, they were one of a hundred or maybe one of a thousand of those were also manaically obscessed fiends working on a very similar obscession.

Things about to exhibit crowdliness are motivated by an urge to deliver something that promises to get past the obstacles of the edgey new thing that the inventors are dreaming about ... people who are crowdly know that a fundamental requirement for success and timeliness of an idea is that there must be a huge pent-up demand for that magical thing that dreamers are talking about in nebulous terms, but has not quite been invented yet ... FB/Twitter, Google, Amazon, Linux, Apple, Microsoft are all examples of products that finally emerged many YEARS, even DECADES after the crowdly folk sort knew that world was looking for those products.

ENORMOUS amounts of talent, money, management talent, promotions are spent on trying to herd the crowd toward a particular alternative ... these resources are committed again and again because: 1) the prize is so huge, ie multiple trillions of dollars and 2) the well-crafted, professional evangelization of a good story or a charismatic storyteller has been at least partially successful at every so slightly getting the early adopters in the crowd to consider an alternative, ie the money spent on mktg pr and evangelization blitz is generally returned and it is less expensive than actually developing something.
