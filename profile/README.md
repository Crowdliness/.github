# The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go

Crowdliness is about making the best of living in an embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing marketplace of marketplaces.

There's plenty of room for argument, of course, but the Crowdliness point-of-view is inherently [positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism) in its outlook.  

It is a strictly a matter of thinking something like "Well, GOOD! That's the way it is. I am going to have any regrets; I am going to work harder at making the best of it."

## Maybe "should" is a word that *SHOULD* be banished from human vocabulary 

There is no room in Crowdliness for what the Crowd *should* do ... "should" is a word that *SHOULD* be banished from human vocabulary ... NOBODY can really control what the Crowd is going to do; it is probably even deeply immoral to suggest what anyone in the crowd *should* do ... it is best to assume that every other human being is going to do what that human being is going to -- the ONLY way to influence is WITHOUT advocating ANY form of coercion, including government-enforced policy but instead to work on an example of DISCIPLINE. 

Crowdliness is therefore entirely anti-terrorism, anti-political, anti-celebrity ... and completely about personal DISCIPLINE and example.

This system of belief rejects ANY and ALL sorts of preachiness as being a complete waste of time ... it is antithetical to any form of technophobia or [Ludditism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) or especially any of the radically anti-technology [points of view heavily influencing the Unabomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unabomber_Manifesto#Influences) ... in spite of OR maybe even BECAUSE of the whining ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.

## Get used to the fact that you will be telemeterized, unless you are willfully anonymous. 

Whether you like or not, [if you are reading this] you have become part of the intensely intelligent, always telemeterized Crowd ... no one one in the Crowd is cutoff from the Crowd; ubiquitous telemetry means that every member of the Crowd is part of, or furnishing data to, the BigMachine ... we define the BigMachine as the vast internetwork of one million key developers and project leaders, one billion actively-engaged power users and at least ten billion [and increasing rapidly] networked, often passive, not-always-human user nodess.

The Crowd has become inescapable in all realms of business, education, science and government. 

Crowdliness is about enjoying Life within the Crowd ... and it's also about unplugging from the Crowd and having some semblance of a healthy life in spite of the Crowd, in the shadow of the Crowd.

Crowdliness is about an inherently social approach to living well within the Crowd. The Crowd has absolutely no need of any additional work evangelically extolling the virtues of things like artificial intelligence, the internet, microprocessors or the transistor. There's also no particular reason to advocate a more outgoing or gregaraious personality. Crowdliness assumes that your personality is not going to change AND it assumes that *progress* in technology will continue, even though many people will not see everything about technology as real progress.

Crowdliness simply assumes that the trend toward embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing big marketplace of interconnected marketplaces will continue unabated ... quite simply, it is hideously STUPID to live life looking in the rear view mirror hoping to go back ... ***we are not going that way*** and no amount of whining will bring about a change in direction, because ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.
