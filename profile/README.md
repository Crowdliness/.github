# Crowdliness Is A Matter Of Listening

Discerning where a crowd is going can feel like some sort of emergent alchemy ... of course, it's not exactly magic ... trying to understand the behavior of crowds is something that humans have been trying to do for at least 5,000 years or more ... the behavior in civilizations or where daily lives are more fixed in that each day tends to look like the day before, likely to be more bureaucratic and constrained because the crowd has opted for a civil solutions, rather than tribal existence in which the days are far from being predictable and tend to be pretty wild and out of control ... but even so, crowds or markets still follow trends or chase fads. Thus, the crowdliness of people in civil society can still *feel* at times like whatever governing preferences or choices is magic or almost like witchcraft or voodoo or driven by propaganda.

But crowds are NOT actually propagandized to the degree that some worry about ... crowds still tend to move in more or less rational directions toward greater security, greater comfort, better foundations of productivity ... it's impossible to say who or what exactly is going to satisfy the crowd's urgent need, but the fact is that crowd is eventually going to go toward where the crowd is going to go.

***The crowd certainly can get fooled ... but the crowd will not stay fooled ... the crowd, like water, will eventually flow in the direction that is going to flow.***

People who are *crowdly* in the same sense that others are shrewd about ways of the world or intelligent in a *worldly*, can sniff out when something is about to attract a crowd because the seemingly random, magic emergence of something with attributes of *crowdliness* is actually a matter of ditching the celebrites, but actually paying closer attention to the kinds of creative intelligence that's working like a fiend but is still out of favor ... those most intelligent, most creative types may eventually be made into *instant* celebrities, but the fact of the matter is that most *overnight successes* were doing two things, once: 1) First of all, they were working like manaical obscessed fiends in complete love with their art, their idea, but they felt like they were all alone AND 2) Secondly, and more importantly, they were one of a hundred or maybe one of a thousand of those were also manaically obscessed fiends working on a very similar obscession.

Things about to exhibit crowdliness are motivated by an urge to deliver something that promises to get past the obstacles of the edgey new thing that the inventors are dreaming about ... people who are crowdly know that a fundamental requirement for success and timeliness of an idea is that there must be a huge pent-up demand for that magical thing that dreamers are talking about in nebulous terms, but has not quite been invented yet ... FB/Twitter, Google, Amazon, Linux, Apple, Microsoft are all examples of products that finally emerged many YEARS, even DECADES after the crowdly folk sort knew that world was looking for those products.

ENORMOUS amounts of talent, money, management talent, promotions are spent on trying to herd the crowd toward a particular alternative. These resources are committed again and again and again because: 1) the prize is so huge, ie multiple trillions of dollars, whereas money spent on mktg, thought leadership content and evangelization is generally cheap for its impact; the cost of making promises is far less expensive than actually developing something that delivers on a promise that proves to be actually important; 2) the well-crafted, professional evangelization of a good story or a charismatic storyteller has been at least partially successful at every so slightly getting the early adopters in the crowd to consider an alternative and divert the crowd's trajectory; 3) getting *out and amongst'm* is a matter of better understanding the customer's use case; observability in an engaged, human-to-human sense helps when the organization is actually smart enough to feed this information back into development efforts. Money spent on marketing, PR, evangelization actually works when it is primarily about LISTENING to the crowd.

# If we want to benefit from the crowd, we need to make ourselves more useful to the crowd.

In order to make ourselves more useful, we need to LISTEN harder, better, faster to the crowd ... rather than waste much time trying to predict what the crowd will do -- those predictions of what the crowd is going to do really only matters for how we go about designing and implementing our listening processes. We need to be present where the crowd is going is going to be, listening on the frequency that the crowd is using.

It's a big deal ... if you can somehow do something that improves the lives of every other human by just 1c per year ... and they share 1/10th of that improvement with you, it accrues to $8,000,0000 per year ... of course, that's only for the purposes of illustration. In general, it's generally going to work out far better to just be measurably and concretely productive, not not expect to ever get paid. The reward will materialize when we make ourselves productive.

Tt's safe to say that MOST people are not helping the crowd in way that actually delivers that one penny's worth of improvement each year.

If want to help the crowd or GENERALLY move things forward for a lot more people, particularly to benefit those at the bottom ... we need to better at understanding what the crowd might need ... first of all, that means LISTENING better ... helping others listen better ... ***to become more crowdly***.

So our name, Crowdliness means that in this effort we try to work at engineering in better listening, better observabilit of humans ... developing better processes to understand what the crowd needs.  We will waste less of our time time trying to predict what the crowd will do ... although we might have to  try to predict how the crowd will change ... because we need to do in order to be more adept at listening.
