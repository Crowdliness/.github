# The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go

... so ***try not to supervise the data too much, okay?***

Crowdliness is about markets in a macro sense ... it's about the study of how crowds and markets learn, weigh data and share information and perhaps build knowledge ... that means that we get into things like [computational semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semiotics), [knowledge graphs for representation and reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) and maybe even some [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).

It's mostly also about making an effort to understand how waves or quanta of information course through interconnected markets or the larger crowd.

In other words, the economics of crowdliness is about making the best of living in some extremely exciting times ... as we move into an embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing marketplace of marketplaces.

There's plenty of room for debate, of course, but the Crowdliness point-of-view is inherently [positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism) in its outlook ... the stance is something like "Let's see if we can make this work." RATHER than to first resist change, to focus solely problems and to fight in some sort of quixotic campaign against shadows of windmills that remind of us of an evil opposing knight.   

It is a strictly a matter of thinking something like "Well, okay. GOOD! That looks like it's the way it is. Regrets won't get us anywhere; let's work harder at making the best of it."

## Maybe "should" is a word that *SHOULD* be banished from human vocabulary

Crowdliness is primarily observational ... about looking at data and finding more ways to evaluate the data ... without imposing too many constraints or supervising the data too much ...  it more about [computational semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semiotics) and [knowledge representation and reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) than it is about imposing any sort of economic modeling or optimization point of view.

There is no room in Crowdliness for what the Crowd *should* do OR how the Crowd *should* react or *should* process the information.

We do not know ***anything*** about how others *should* act; this is even worse, if our objectively is clouded by what our *experience* tells us ... we do not know ... "should" is a word that *SHOULD* be banished from human vocabulary.

NOBODY can really control what the Crowd is going to do; it is probably even deeply immoral to suggest what anyone in the crowd *should* do ... it is best to assume that every other human being is going to do what that human being is going to -- the ONLY way to influence is WITHOUT advocating ANY form of coercion, including government-enforced policy but instead to work on an example of DISCIPLINE. 

Crowdliness is therefore entirely anti-terrorism, anti-political, anti-celebrity ... and completely about personal DISCIPLINE and example.

This system of belief rejects ANY and ALL sorts of preachiness as being a complete waste of time ... it is antithetical to any form of technophobia or [Ludditism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) or especially any of the radically anti-technology [points of view heavily influencing the Unabomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unabomber_Manifesto#Influences) ... in spite of OR maybe even BECAUSE of the whining ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.

## Get used to the fact that you will be telemeterized, unless you are willfully anonymous. 

Whether you like or not, [if you are reading this] you have become part of the intensely intelligent, always telemeterized Crowd ... no one one in the Crowd is cutoff from the Crowd; ubiquitous telemetry means that every member of the Crowd is part of, or furnishing data to, the BigMachine ... we define the BigMachine as the vast internetwork of one million key developers and project leaders, one billion actively-engaged power users and at least ten billion [and increasing rapidly] networked, often passive, not-always-human user nodess.

The Crowd has become inescapable in all realms of business, education, science and government. 

Crowdliness is about enjoying Life within the Crowd ... and it's also about unplugging from the Crowd and having some semblance of a healthy life in spite of the Crowd, in the shadow of the Crowd.

Crowdliness is about an inherently social approach to living well within the Crowd. The Crowd has absolutely no need of any additional work evangelically extolling the virtues of things like artificial intelligence, the internet, microprocessors or the transistor. There's also no particular reason to advocate a more outgoing or gregaraious personality. Crowdliness assumes that your personality is not going to change AND it assumes that *progress* in technology will continue, even though many people will not see everything about technology as real progress.

Crowdliness simply assumes that the trend toward embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing big marketplace of interconnected marketplaces will continue unabated ... quite simply, it is hideously STUPID to live life looking in the rear view mirror hoping to go back ... ***we are not going that way*** and no amount of whining will bring about a change in direction, because ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.
