# The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go

... so ***try not to supervise the data so much, okay ... Okay?***

Crowdliness is about things that attract interest, cause events to happen and lead markets to spring into existence in a macro sense ... it's about information, knowledge, innovation and the study of how crowds are initiated and then the accelerated negotiation that we find in auction, exchanges and secondary markets leads to people learning how the new thing works, what revisions make it work a lot better, seeking out data on why somthing is trending ... and then through their attention, attendance, bidding, purchases, investments in related companies ... market participants generally convey incredibly useful information about the productivity of innovations and generally lead to accelerating the pace of development and the intensity of building of productive, ie return-generating, knowledge.

The study of crowdliness is about the genesis of the microfoundations of microeconomics ... which means that analysis of the data takes into areas like [computational semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semiotics), [knowledge graphs for representation and reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) and maybe even some mathematics underpinning [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).

It's mostly also about making an effort to understand how waves or quanta of information course through interconnected markets and especially the part of the larger crowd comprised of shrewd, but early adopters, the key supporters who use the betas and possibly invest, refine or shape new innovations successfully.

In other words, the economics of crowdliness is about making the very best of living in some extremely exciting times ... as we move into an embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing marketplace of marketplaces ... how can we experience life more creatively, more experimentally, more joyfully.

There's plenty of room for debate, of course, but the pro-Crowdliness point-of-view is inherently optimistic and [positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism) in its outlook ... the stance is something like "Let's see if we can make this work." RATHER than to first think in terms of resisting change or focusing solely problems and to fight in some sort of quixotic campaign against shadows of windmills that remind of us of an evil opposing knight.   

It is a strictly a matter of thinking something like "Well, okay, then. GOOD! That looks like it's the way it is, then!" 

## Maybe "should" is a word that *SHOULD* be banished from human vocabulary

Regret or longing for the past is too heavy of a burden to carry ... as we examine the data of crowdliness, we should resist the urge to supervise the learning in the models ... let the structure of the data as it forms show us what the structure of the data is.

Crowdliness is primarily observational; trying to better observe, to look at the horizon ahead, rather than to look in the rear view mirror ... about gathering data sources, wrangling data and finding better ways to evaluate the data ... without imposing too many constraints or supervising the data too much ...  it more about [computational semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semiotics) and [knowledge representation and reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) than it is about imposing any sort of economic modeling or optimization point of view.

NOBODY can really control what the Crowd is going to do; it is probably even deeply immoral to suggest what anyone in the crowd *should* do ... it is best to assume that every other human being is going to do what that human being is going to -- the ONLY way to influence is WITHOUT advocating ANY form of coercion, including government-enforced policy but instead to work on an example of DISCIPLINE. 

Crowdliness is therefore entirely anti-terrorism, anti-political, anti-celebrity ... and completely about personal DISCIPLINE and example.

This system of belief rejects ANY and ALL sorts of preachiness as being a complete waste of time ... it is antithetical to any form of technophobia or [Ludditism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) or especially any of the radically anti-technology [points of view heavily influencing the Unabomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unabomber_Manifesto#Influences) ... in spite of OR maybe even BECAUSE of the whining ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.

## Get used to the fact that you will be telemeterized, unless you are willfully anonymous. 

Whether you like or not, [if you are reading this] you have become part of the intensely intelligent, always telemeterized Crowd ... no one one in the Crowd is cutoff from the Crowd; ubiquitous telemetry means that every member of the Crowd is part of, or furnishing data to, the BigMachine ... we define the BigMachine as the vast internetwork of one million key developers and project leaders, one billion actively-engaged power users and at least ten billion [and increasing rapidly] networked, often passive, not-always-human user nodess.

The Crowd has become inescapable in all realms of business, education, science and government. 

Crowdliness is about enjoying Life within the Crowd ... and it's also about unplugging from the Crowd and having some semblance of a healthy life in spite of the Crowd, in the shadow of the Crowd.

Crowdliness is about an inherently social approach to living well within the Crowd. The Crowd has absolutely no need of any additional work evangelically extolling the virtues of things like artificial intelligence, the internet, microprocessors or the transistor. There's also no particular reason to advocate a more outgoing or gregaraious personality. Crowdliness assumes that your personality is not going to change AND it assumes that *progress* in technology will continue, even though many people will not see everything about technology as real progress.

Crowdliness simply assumes that the trend toward embarrassingly internetworked, massively social-network-of-social-networks, hybrid human-machie information-weighing big marketplace of interconnected marketplaces will continue unabated ... quite simply, it is hideously STUPID to live life looking in the rear view mirror hoping to go back ... ***we are not going that way*** and no amount of whining will bring about a change in direction, because ... ***The Crowd is going to go where the the Crowd is going to go***.
