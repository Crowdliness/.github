# Crowdsourced Content On Crowdliness

The **#IsItTrue** [polls on the topic of Crowdliness, as tweeted by @Crowdliness](https://twitter.com/Crowdliness) with the "***Yes! Here's why it's so ↓***" and ***No! Here's why it's not ↓***" responses in the comments.

Crowds sometimes get it wrong ... perhaps it is a matter of good intentions or something that the crowd desperately wants to hold true. However, we kinda have to believe that anything that strays far from the truth as the truth really is actually is dangerous ... ... that's especially true of economic or market truths or when we are referring to some behavior that crowd of humanity exhibits ... we cannot really avoid how crowds affect us ... sometimes the most tired old cliches that we sick of hearing actually are true, eg no man is an island. We study crowds for a reason.


[Theses #1](#1). [Markets are conversations.](https://twitter.com/crowdliness/status/1604861827028066304) [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 1–6: Markets are Conversations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_1%E2%80%936:_Markets_are_Conversations). Maybe, but probably not true. Markets are far, far more than phatic conversation, chit chat in bar or any sort of gossip or speculative banter. Markets are more than serious conversations, because, even in small transactions, actual $ changes hands between buyers and sellers ... and there are bidders and others on the sideline listening intently, because they too have serious skin in the game, so it's not as if those listening in are just listening to banter about the Super Bowl, idle chatter or idiotic gossip. Most conversations are quitely simply just hot air, ie never as important as what is happening in a market.

[Theses #2](#2).  Markets consist of human beings, not demographic sectors. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 1–6: Markets are Conversations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_1%E2%80%936:_Markets_are_Conversations)

[Theses #4](#3). Conversations among human beings sound human. They are conducted in a human voice. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 1–6: Markets are Conversations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_1%E2%80%936:_Markets_are_Conversations)

[Theses #4](#4). Whether delivering information, opinions, perspectives, dissenting arguments or humorous asides, the human voice is typically open, natural, uncontrived. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 1–6: Markets are Conversations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_1%E2%80%936:_Markets_are_Conversations)

[Theses #5](#5). People recognize each other as such from the sound of this voice. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 1–6: Markets are Conversations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_1%E2%80%936:_Markets_are_Conversations)

[Theses #6](#6). The Internet is enabling conversations among human beings that were simply not possible in the era of mass media. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 1–6: Markets are Conversations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_1%E2%80%936:_Markets_are_Conversations)

[Theses #7](#7). Hyperlinks subvert hierarchy. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Thesis 7: Hyperlinks Subvert Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Thesis_7:_Hyperlinks_Subvert_Hierarchy)

[Theses #8](#8). In both internetworked markets and among intranetworked employees, people are speaking to each other in a powerful new way. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 8 – 13: Connection between the new markets and companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_8%E2%80%9313:_Connection_between_the_new_markets_and_companies)

[Theses #9](#9). These networked conversations are enabling powerful new forms of social organization and knowledge exchange to emerge. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 8 – 13: Connection between the new markets and companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_8%E2%80%9313:_Connection_between_the_new_markets_and_companies)

[Theses #10](#10). As a result, markets are getting smarter, more informed, more organized. Participation in a networked market changes people fundamentally. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 8 – 13: Connection between the new markets and companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_8%E2%80%9313:_Connection_between_the_new_markets_and_companies)

[Theses #11](#11). People in networked markets have figured out that they get far better information and support from one another than from vendors. So much for corporate rhetoric about adding value to commoditized products. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 8 – 13: Connection between the new markets and companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_8%E2%80%9313:_Connection_between_the_new_markets_and_companies)

[Theses #12](#12). There are no secrets. The networked market knows more than companies do about their own products. And whether the news is good or bad, they tell everyone. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 8 – 13: Connection between the new markets and companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_8%E2%80%9313:_Connection_between_the_new_markets_and_companies)

[Theses #13](#13). What's happening to markets is also happening among employees. A metaphysical construct called "The Company" is the only thing standing between the two. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 8 – 13: Connection between the new markets and companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_8%E2%80%9313:_Connection_between_the_new_markets_and_companies)

[Theses #14](#14). Corporations do not speak in the same voice as these new networked conversations. To their intended online audiences, companies sound hollow, flat, literally inhuman. [**Cluetrain Manifesto** Theses 14 – 25: Organizations entering the marketplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto#Theses_14_%E2%80%93_25:_Organizations_entering_the_marketplace)

[Theses #15](#15). In just a few more years, the current homogenized "voice" of business — the sound of mission statements and brochures —will seem as contrived and artificial as the language of the 18th century French court.

[Theses #16](#16). Already, companies that speak in the language of the pitch, the dog-and-pony show, are no longer speaking to anyone.

[Theses #17](#17). Companies that assume online markets are the same markets that used to watch their ads on television are kidding themselves.

[Theses #18](#18). Companies that don't realize their markets are now networked person-to-person, getting smarter as a result and deeply joined in conversation are missing their best opportunity.

[Theses #19](#19). Companies can now communicate with their markets directly. If they blow it, it could be their last chance.

[Theses #20](#20). Companies need to realize their markets are often laughing. At them.

[Theses #21](#21). Companies need to lighten up and take themselves less seriously. They need to get a sense of humor.

[Theses #22](#22). Getting a sense of humor does not mean putting some jokes on the corporate web site. Rather, it requires big values, a little humility, straight talk, and a genuine point of view.

[Theses #23](#23). Companies attempting to "position" themselves need to take a position. Optimally, it should relate to something their market actually cares about.

[Theses #24](#24). Bombastic boasts —"*We are positioned to become the preeminent provider of XYZ*" —do not constitute a position.

[Theses #25](#25). Companies need to come down from their Ivory Towers and talk to the people with whom they hope to create relationships.

[Theses #26](#26). Public Relations does not relate to the public. Companies are deeply afraid of their markets.

[Theses #27](#27). By speaking in language that is distant, uninviting, arrogant, they build walls to keep markets at bay.

[Theses #28](#28). Most marketing programs are based on the fear that the market might see what's really going on inside the company.

[Theses #29](#29). Elvis said it best: "We can't go on together with suspicious minds."

[Theses #30](#30). Brand loyalty is the corporate version of going steady, but the breakup is inevitable —and coming fast. Because they are networked, smart markets are able to renegotiate relationships with blinding speed.

[Theses #31](#31). Networked markets can change suppliers overnight. Networked knowledge workers can change employers over lunch. Your own "downsizing initiatives" taught us to ask the question: "Loyalty? What's that?"

[Theses #32](#32). Smart markets will find suppliers who speak their own language.

[Theses #33](#33). Learning to speak with a human voice is not a parlor trick. It can't be "picked up" at some tony conference.

[Theses #34](#34). To speak with a human voice, companies must share the concerns of their communities.

[Theses #35](#35). But first, they must belong to a community.

[Theses #36](#36). Companies must ask themselves where their corporate cultures end.

[Theses #37](#37). If their cultures end before the community begins, they will have no market.

[Theses #38](#38). Human communities are based on discourse — on human speech about human concerns.

[Theses #39](#39). The community of discourse is the market.

[Theses #40](#40). Companies that do not belong to a community of discourse will die.

[Theses #41](#41). Companies make a religion of security, but this is largely a red herring. Most are protecting less against competitors than against their own market and workforce.

[Theses #42](#42). As with networked markets, people are also talking to each other directly inside the company — and not just about rules and regulations, boardroom directives, bottom lines.

[Theses #43](#43). Such conversations are taking place today on corporate intranets. But only when the conditions are right.

[Theses #44](#44). Companies typically install intranets top-down to distribute HR policies and other corporate information that workers are doing their best to ignore.

[Theses #45](#45). Intranets naturally tend to route around boredom. The best are built bottom-up by engaged individuals cooperating to construct something far more valuable: an intranetworked corporate conversation.

[Theses #46](#46). A healthy intranet organizes workers in many meanings of the word. Its effect is more radical than the agenda of any union.

[Theses #47](#47). While this scares companies witless, they also depend heavily on open intranets to generate and share critical knowledge. They need to resist the urge to "improve" or control these networked conversations.

[Theses #48](#48). When corporate intranets are not constrained by fear and legalistic rules, the type of conversation they encourage sounds remarkably like the conversation of the networked marketplace.

[Theses #49](#49). Org charts worked in an older economy where plans could be fully understood from atop steep management pyramids and detailed work orders could be handed down from on high.

[Theses #50](#50). Today, the org chart is hyperlinked, not hierarchical. Respect for hands-on knowledge wins over respect for abstract authority.

[Theses #51](#51). Command-and-control management styles both derive from and reinforce bureaucracy, power tripping and an overall culture of paranoia.

[Theses #52](#52). Paranoia kills conversation. That's its point. But lack of open conversation kills companies.

[Theses #53](#53). There are two conversations going on. One inside the company. One with the market.

[Theses #54](#54). In most cases, neither conversation is going very well. Almost invariably, the cause of failure can be traced to obsolete notions of command and control.

[Theses #55](#55). As policy, these notions are poisonous. As tools, they are broken. Command and control are met with hostility by intranetworked knowledge workers and generate distrust in internetworked markets.

[Theses #56](#56). These two conversations want to talk to each other. They are speaking the same language. They recognize each other's voices.

[Theses #57](#57). Smart companies will get out of the way and help the inevitable to happen sooner.

[Theses #58](#58). If willingness to get out of the way is taken as a measure of IQ, then very few companies have yet wised up.

[Theses #59](#59). However subliminally at the moment, millions of people now online perceive companies as little more than quaint legal fictions that are actively preventing these conversations from intersecting.

[Theses #60](#60). This is suicidal. Markets want to talk to companies.

[Theses #61](#61). Sadly, the part of the company a networked market wants to talk to is usually hidden behind a smokescreen of hucksterism, of language that rings false — and often is.

[Theses #62](#62). Markets do not want to talk to flacks and hucksters. They want to participate in the conversations going on behind the corporate firewall.

[Theses #63](#63). De-cloaking, getting personal: We are those markets. We want to talk to you.

[Theses #64](#64). We want access to your corporate information, to your plans and strategies, your best thinking, your genuine knowledge. We will not settle for the 4-color brochure, for web sites chock-a-block with eye candy but lacking any substance.

[Theses #65](#65). We're also the workers who make your companies go. We want to talk to customers directly in our own voices, not in platitudes written into a script.

[Theses #66](#66). As markets, as workers, both of us are sick to death of getting our information by remote control. Why do we need faceless annual reports and third-hand market research studies to introduce us to each other?

[Theses #67](#67). As markets, as workers, we wonder why you're not listening. You seem to be speaking a different language.

[Theses #68](#68). The inflated self-important jargon you sling around —in the press, at your conferences —what's that got to do with us?

[Theses #69](#69). Maybe you're impressing your investors. Maybe you're impressing Wall Street. You're not impressing us.

[Theses #70](#70). If you don't impress us, your investors are going to take a bath. Don't they understand this? If they did, they wouldn't let you talk that way.

[Theses #71](#71). Your tired notions of "the market" make our eyes glaze over. We don't recognize ourselves in your projections —perhaps because we know we're already elsewhere.

[Theses #72](#72). We like this new marketplace much better. In fact, we are creating it.

[Theses #73](#73). You're invited, but it's our world. Take your shoes off at the door. If you want to barter with us, get down off that camel!

[Theses #74](#74). We are immune to advertising. Just forget it.

[Theses #75](#75). If you want us to talk to you, tell us something. Make it something interesting for a change.

[Theses #76](#76). We've got some ideas for you too: some new tools we need, some better service. Stuff we'd be willing to pay for. Got a minute?

[Theses #77](#77). You're too busy "doing business" to answer our email? Oh gosh, sorry, gee, we'll come back later. Maybe.

[Theses #78](#78). You want us to pay? We want you to pay attention.

[Theses #79](#79). We want you to drop your trip, come out of your neurotic self-involvement, join the party.

[Theses #80](#80). Don't worry, you can still make money. That is, as long as it's not the only thing on your mind.

[Theses #81](#81). Have you noticed that, in itself, money is kind of one-dimensional and boring? What else can we talk about?

[Theses #82](#82). Your product broke. Why? We'd like to ask the guy who made it. Your corporate strategy makes no sense. We'd like to have a chat with your CEO. What do you mean she's not in?

[Theses 83](#83). Research in the field of medicine. Now it is easy to buy viagra online for men.

[Theses #84](#84). We know some people from your company. They're pretty cool online. Do you have any more like that you're hiding? Can they come out and play?

[Theses #85](#85). When we have questions we turn to each other for answers. If you didn't have such a tight rein on "your people" maybe they'd be among the people we'd turn to.

[Theses #86](#86). When we're not busy being your "target market," many of us are your people. We'd rather be talking to friends online than watching the clock. That would get your name around better than your entire million dollar web site. But you tell us speaking to the market is Marketing's job.

[Theses #87](#87). We'd like it if you got what's going on here. That'd be real nice. But it would be a big mistake to think we're holding our breath.

[Theses #88](#88). We have better things to do than worry about whether you'll change in time to get our business. Business is only a part of our lives. It seems to be all of yours. Think about it: who needs whom?

[Theses #89](#89). We have real power and we know it. If you don't quite see the light, some other outfit will come along that's more attentive, more interesting, more fun to play with.

[Theses #90](#90). Even at its worst, our newfound conversation is more interesting than most trade shows, more entertaining than any TV sitcom, and certainly more true-to-life than the corporate web sites we've been seeing.

[Theses #91](#91). Our allegiance is to ourselves — our friends, our new allies and acquaintances, even our sparring partners. Companies that have no part in this world, also have no future.

[Theses #92](#92). Companies are spending billions of dollars on Y2K. Why can't they hear this market timebomb ticking? The stakes are even higher.

[Theses #93](#93). We're both inside companies and outside them. The boundaries that separate our conversations look like the Berlin Wall today, but they're really just an annoyance. We know they're coming down. We're going to work from both sides to take them down.

[Theses #94](#94). To traditional corporations, networked conversations may appear confused, may sound confusing. But we are organizing faster than they are. We have better tools, more new ideas, no rules to slow us down.

[Theses #95](#95). We are waking up and linking to each other. We are watching. But we are not waiting.

The Internet is us, connected.
1The Internet is not made of copper wire, glass fiber, radio waves, or even tubes.
2The devices we use to connect to the Internet are not the Internet.
3Verizon, Comcast, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, and 中国电信 do not own the Internet. Facebook, Google, and Amazon are not the Net's monarchs, nor yet are their minions or algorithms. Not the governments of the Earth nor their Trade Associations have the consent of the networked to bestride the Net as sovereigns.
4We hold the Internet in common and as unowned.
5From us and from what we have built on it does the Internet derive all its value.
6The Net is of us, by us, and for us.
7The Internet is ours.
b. The Internet is nothing and has no purpose.
8The Internet is not a thing any more than gravity is a thing. Both pull us together.
9The Internet is no-thing at all. At its base the Internet is a set of agreements, which the geeky among us (long may their names be hallowed) call "protocols," but which we might, in the temper of the day, call "commandments."
10The first among these is: Thy network shall move all packets closer to their destinations without favor or delay based on origin, source, content, or intent.
11Thus does this First Commandment lay open the Internet to every idea, application, business, quest, vice, and whatever.
12There has not been a tool with such a general purpose since language.
13This means the Internet is not for anything in particular. Not for social networking, not for documents, not for advertising, not for business, not for education, not for porn, not for anything. It is specifically designed for everything.
14Optimizing the Internet for one purpose de-optimizes it for all others.
15The Internet like gravity is indiscriminate in its attraction. It pulls us all together, the virtuous and the wicked alike.
c. The Net is not content.
16There is great content on the Internet. But holy mother of cheeses, the Internet is not made out of content.
17A teenager's first poem, the blissful release of a long-kept secret, a fine sketch drawn by a palsied hand, a blog post in a regime that hates the sound of its people's voices — none of these people sat down to write content.
18Did we use the word "content" without quotes? We feel so dirty.
d. The Net is not a medium.
19The Net is not a medium any more than a conversation is a medium.
20On the Net, we are the medium. We are the ones who move messages. We do so every time we post or retweet, send a link in an email, or post it on a social network.
21Unlike a medium, you and I leave our fingerprints, and sometimes bite marks, on the messages we pass. We tell people why we're sending it. We argue with it. We add a joke. We chop off the part we don't like. We make these messages our own.
22Every time we move a message through the Net, it carries a little bit of ourselves with it.
23We only move a message through this "medium" if it matters to us in one of the infinite ways that humans care about something.
24Caring — mattering — is the motive force of the Internet.

e The Web is a Wide World.
25In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee used the Net to create a gift he gave freely to us all: the World Wide Web. Thank you.
26Tim created the Web by providing protocols (there's that word again!) that say how to write a page that can link to any other page without needing anyone's permission.
27Boom. Within ten years we had billions of pages on the Web — a combined effort on the order of a World War, and yet so benign that the biggest complaint was the <blink> tag.
28The Web is an impossibly large, semi-persistent realm of items discoverable in their dense inter-connections.
29That sounds familiar. Oh, yeah, that's what the world is.
30Unlike the real world, every thing and every connection on the Web was created by some one of us expressing an interest and an assumption about how those small pieces go together.
31Every link by a person with something to say is an act of generosity and selflessness, bidding our readers leave our page to see how the world looks to someone else.
32The Web remakes the world in our collective, emergent image.
a. How did we let conversation get weaponized, anyway?
33It's important to notice and cherish the talk, the friendship, the thousand acts of sympathy, kindness, and joy we encounter on the Internet.
34And yet we hear the words "fag" and "n*gger" far more on the Net than off.
35Demonization of 'them' — people with looks, languages, opinions, memberships and other groupings we don't understand, like, or tolerate — is worse than ever on the Internet.
36Women in Saudi Arabia can't drive? Meanwhile, half of us can't speak on the Net without looking over our shoulders.
37Hatred is present on the Net because it's present in the world, but the Net makes it easier to express and to hear.
38The solution: If we had a solution, we wouldn't be bothering you with all these damn clues.
39We can say this much: Hatred didn't call the Net into being, but it's holding the Net — and us — back.
40Let's at least acknowledge that the Net has values implicit in it. Human values.
41Viewed coldly the Net is just technology. But it's populated by creatures who are warm with what they care about: their lives, their friends, the world we share.
42The Net offers us a common place where we can be who we are, with others who delight in our differences.
43No one owns that place. Everybody can use it. Anyone can improve it.
44That's what an open Internet is. Wars have been fought for less.
b. "We agree about everything. I find you fascinating!"
45The world is spread out before us like a buffet, and yet we stick with our steak and potatoes, lamb and hummus, fish and rice, or whatever.
46We do this in part because conversation requires a common ground: shared language, interests, norms, understandings. Without those, it's hard or even impossible to have a conversation.
47Shared grounds spawn tribes. The Earth's solid ground kept tribes at a distance, enabling them to develop rich differences. Rejoice! Tribes give rise to Us vs. Them and war. Rejoice? Not so much.
48On the Internet, the distance between tribes starts at zero.
49Apparently knowing how to find one another interesting is not as easy as it looks.
50That's a challenge we can meet by being open, sympathetic, and patient. We can do it, team! We're #1! We're #1!
51Being welcoming: There's a value the Net needs to learn from the best of our real world cultures.
c. Marketing still makes it harder to talk.
52We were right the first time: Markets are conversations.
53A conversation isn't your business tugging at our sleeve to shill a product we don't want to hear about.
54if we want to know the truth about your products, we'll find out from one another.
55We understand that these conversations are incredibly valuable to you. Too bad. They're ours.
56You're welcome to join our conversation, but only if you tell us who you work for, and if you can speak for yourself and as yourself.
57Every time you call us "consumers" we feel like cows looking up the word "meat."
58Quit fracking our lives to extract data that's none of your business and that your machines misinterpret.
59Don't worry: we'll tell you when we're in the market for something. In our own way. Not yours. Trust us: this will be good for you.
60Ads that sound human but come from your marketing department's irritable bowels, stain the fabric of the Web.
61When personalizing something is creepy, it's a pretty good indication that you don't understand what it means to be a person.
62Personal is human. Personalized isn't.
63The more machines sound human, the more they slide down into the uncanny valley where everything is a creep show.
64Also: Please stop dressing up ads as news in the hope we'll miss the little disclaimer hanging off their underwear.
Je suis Charlie.

65When you place a "native ad," you're eroding not just your own trustworthiness, but the trustworthiness of this entire new way of being with one another.
66And, by the way, how about calling "native ads" by any of their real names: "product placement," "advertorial," or "fake fucking news"?
67Advertisers got along without being creepy for generations. They can get along without being creepy on the Net, too.
d. The Gitmo of the Net.
68We all love our shiny apps, even when they're sealed as tight as a Moon base. But put all the closed apps in the world together and you have a pile of apps.
69Put all the Web pages together and you have a new world.
70Web pages are about connecting. Apps are about control.
71As we move from the Web to an app-based world, we lose the commons we were building together.
72In the Kingdom of Apps, we are users, not makers.
73Every new page makes the Web bigger. Every new link makes the Web richer.
74Every new app gives us something else to do on the bus.
75Ouch, a cheap shot!
76Hey, "CheapShot" would make a great new app! It's got "in-app purchase" written all over it.
e Gravity's great until it sucks us all into a black hole.
77Non-neutral applications built on top of the neutral Net are becoming as inescapable as the pull of a black hole.
78If Facebook is your experience of the Net, then you've strapped on goggles from a company with a fiduciary responsibility to keep you from ever taking the goggles off.
79Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple are all in the goggles business.  The biggest truth their goggles obscure: These companies want to hold us the way black holes hold light.
80These corporate singularities are dangerous not because they are evil. Many of them in fact engage in quite remarkably civic behavior. They should be applauded for that.
81But they benefit from the gravity of sociality: The "network effect" is that thing where lots of people use something because lots of people use it.
82Where there aren't competitive alternatives, we need to be hypervigilant to remind these Titans of the Valley of the webby values that first inspired them.
83And then we need to honor the sound we make when any of us bravely pulls away from them. It's something between the noise of a rocket leaving the launchpad and the rip of Velcro as you undo a too-tight garment.
f. Privacy in an age of spies.
84Ok, government, you win. You've got our data. Now, what can we do to make sure you use it against Them and not against Us? In fact, can you tell the difference?
85If we want our government to back off, the deal has to be that if — when — the next attack comes, we can't complain that they should have surveilled us harder.
86A trade isn't fair trade if we don't know what we're giving up. Do you hear that, Security for Privacy trade-off?
87With a probability approaching absolute certainty, we are going to be sorry we didn't do more to keep data out of the hands of our governments and corporate overlords.
g. Privacy in an age of weasels.
88Personal privacy is fine for those who want it. And we all draw the line somewhere.
89Q: How long do you think it took for pre-Web culture to figure out where to draw the lines? A: How old is culture?
90 The Web is barely out of its teens. We are at the beginning, not the end, of the privacy story.
91We can only figure out what it means to be private once we  figure out what it means to be social. And we've barely begun to re-invent that.
92The economic and political incentives to de-pants and up-skirt  us are so strong that we'd be wise to invest in tinfoil underwear.
93Hackers got us into this and hackers will have to get us out.

a. Kumbiyah sounds surprisingly good in an echo chamber.
94The Internet is astounding. The Web is awesome. You are beautiful. Connect us all and we are more crazily amazing than Jennifer Lawrence. These are simple facts.
95So let's not minimize what the Net has done in the past twenty years:
96There's so much more music in the world.
97We now make most of our culture for ourselves, with occasional forays to a movie theater for something blowy-uppy and a $9 nickel-bag of popcorn.
98Politicians now have to explain their positions far beyond the one-page "position papers" they used to mimeograph.
99Anything you don't understand you can find an explanation for. And a discussion about. And an argument over. Is it not clear how awesome that is?
100You want to know what to buy? The business that makes an object of desire is now the worst source of information about it. The best source is all of us.
101You want to listen in on a college-level course about something you're interested in? Google your topic. Take your pick. For free.
102Yeah, the Internet hasn't solved all the world's problems. That's why the Almighty hath given us asses: that we might get off of them.
103Internet naysayers keep us honest. We just like 'em better when they aren't ingrates.
b. A pocket full of homilies.
104We were going to tell you how to fix the Internet in four easy steps, but the only one we could remember is the last one: profit. So instead, here are some random thoughts…
105We should be supporting the artists and creators who bring us delight or ease our burdens.
106We should have the courage to ask for the help we need.
107We have a culture that defaults to sharing and laws that default to copyright. Copyright has its place, but when in doubt, open it up.
108In the wrong context, everyone's an a-hole. (Us, too. But you already knew that.) So if you're inviting people over for a swim, post the rules. All trolls, out of the pool!
109If the conversations at your site are going badly, it's your fault.
110Wherever the conversation is happening, no one owes you a response, no matter how reasonable your argument or how winning your smile.
111Support the businesses that truly "get" the Web. You'll recognize them not just because they sound like us, but because they're on our side.
112Sure, apps offer a nice experience. But the Web is about links that constantly reach out, connecting us without end. For lives and ideas, completion is death. Choose life.
113Anger is a license to be stupid. The Internet's streets are already crowded with licensed drivers.
114Live the values you want the Internet to promote.
115If you've been talking for a while, shut up. (We will very soon.)
c. Being together: the cause of and solution to every problem.
116If we have focused on the role of the People of the Net  — you and us — in the Internet's fall from grace, that's because we still have the faith we came in with.
117We, the People of the Net, cannot fathom how much we can do together because we are far from finished inventing how to be together.
118The Internet has liberated an ancient force — the gravity drawing us together.
119The gravity of connection is love.
120Long live the open Internet.
121Long may we have our Internet to love.

We will also include quoteworthy utterances from sources that we come across ... some things sound good, uplifting and may tell us what we would like to believe -- but are just not quite true.
